<h1>Three generations of mothers talk about their parenting philosophies</h1>
<h2>

<p>COLUMBIA — Motherhood is as old as time and as universal as, well, motherhood. But how mothers are viewed by society and view their own roles has shifted with generations, expectations, culture, region, religion, research and the realities of everything from economics to exhaustion.</p>

<p>From Freud's theories about the role of mothers to the 1950s bible of mothering advice by Dr. Benjamin Spock to today's ferocious Tiger Mom and the latest trend in “attachment parenting,” with several stops in between, the range of mothering approaches and attitudes and pressures is expansive and sometimes contentious.</p>

<p>Take the term “Mommy Wars.” It was first used to shine light on the tension between careerist and stay-at-home moms. These days the mommy blogs debate “gentle” parenting versus strict discipline, vaccination versus no chemicals, structured education versus “free-range” learning, organic food versus Chuck E. Cheese.</p>

<p>We could go on, and no doubt countless social scientists are doing just that, studying what constitutes motherhood today.</p>

<p>Instead, as we honor all mothers this Mother’s Day (with more than a tip-of-the-hat to the dads), we talk to women from three families and multiple generations to hear their thoughts on everything from discipline to dating to tattoos. Their comments provide a glimpse into the influences that shape mothers of yesterday, today and, perhaps, tomorrow.</p> 

<p>(Parents: We'd love to hear from you. If this story makes you want to join the conversation, consider contributing to our From Readers section.)</p>
